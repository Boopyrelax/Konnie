# Konnie
Artist website
-------------

### Before project:

#### General aspect:
- Header: pull right 4 categories ; Home, Bio, Artist on the same page and then News (How to add a second language? a flag a dropdown menu ?...)
- Grey background (with pattern ?)
- White header and footer fixed
- Footer: socials links, twitter (a professional one ?), Facebook page (to create), instagram, spotify, Email google address

#### Body (spy scrolling):
###### Home: 
 * SÃ©pia picture of Konnie (her actual Facebook profile picture ?)
 * Konnie Metaxa written in english in a solid white border center in the middle of the page with her resume to download and her mail address (a contact page ?)
 * What will look like the home on a portrait view or on a smartphone...

###### Bio:
 * Headshots carousel
 * A short story about Konnie, who she is what she achieved speak about her specific skills and her training
 * Need to think on how the carousel can appear nicely in every screen and not cut !
 
###### Artist:
 * First block - Theater : Theater links to the university mostly check with her if there is more
 * Second block - Music : youtube video of the new song and Musical (is it pertinent to put the musicals here do we need to have a fourth block? or add them to theater?)
 * Third block - Television : Greek ModernFamily with Megachannel links check with her if there is subtitles versions of it

Work on the :hover to do and see what she want to say for each part

###### News:
 * Feedback of her carriers plans (what will come + what does the press says)
Find a plugin to link this newsfeed to the official facebook page she is supposed to create ?
